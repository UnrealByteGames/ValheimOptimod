A mod to optimize, get full settings control and improve the FPS in Valheim.

## Manual Installation

 1. Install the BepInExPack Valheim.
    https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/
    
 2. Download the zip and extract the DLL file to the `<GameDirectory>\BepInEx\plugins\` folder.

## Configuration
The config can be found in the `<GameDirectory>\BepInEx\config\` folder after the first start up.
In the file you will find a lot of graphic settings to modify. The perfect combination depends on the pc specs, so it's up to you to find it.

You will also find a [Zones] setting. This affects how the game handles the loading of zones, for more information see: https://valheim.fandom.com/wiki/Zones
